## Resources

### Purpose

As an attendee I am given technical challenges to configure my workstation that require me to use Resources to resolve my configuration requirements.

### Motivation

The motivation is to provide a simple tangible use case by focusing solely on Resources. This smaller scope at the outset gives attendees the ability to see the value and effectiveness of Chef from the outset. Mastery of Resources, in this smaller domain, allows us to focus on a fundamental piece of Chef without the other overhead of the concepts.
