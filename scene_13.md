## Managing Multiple Nodes

We give the attendees a new node. We ask the attendees to demonstrate:

* Bootstrapping a new node
* Adding the recipes to make it a web node
* Updating the wrapper proxy cookbook to include this new node.

We ask the attendees to validate that they can reach the two web nodes separately and occassionly see the two different nodes through the proxy.

We talk about the new struggle of managing and doing minor reporting on the nodes within our infrastructure.

We demonstrate a few ways that we can reason about the nodes through the command-line and web interface.
